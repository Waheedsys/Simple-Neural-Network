# Simple-Neural-Network
This repository contains a simple implementation of a neural network for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The project is built from scratch using NumPy, aiming to provide a clear understanding of the fundamental concepts of neural networks, including forward propagation, backward propagation, and gradient descent.
